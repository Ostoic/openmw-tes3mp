How to compile openmw-tes3mp
- install dependencies by running before_* installer script for your OS located in the CI/ folder

- make sure the above script is for your version of Visual Studio. Otherwise you will have to add a new entry to the 
  list of msvc versions.
  
- this will download and install dependencies (boost, Qt, RakNet, etc) to the deps/ folder.

- ^(this isn't really necessary as long as you point the cmake config to all the necessary dependencies).

- take pretty much whatever dependency version (as long as it's fairly recent) and put it into your new build folder'script
  deps/ folder. You will have to configure cmake to use Qt5 probably. Afterwards, you'll have to find all the dependencies
  for CMake (Qt, FFMpeg, Bullet, CrabNet, etc). A trick is to find the base directory for each subdependency and then copy it
  for all the other subdependencies of the current dependency. CMake will be able to find the files.
  
- each dependency's CMake find module is slightly different in how it searches for its library and include folders, so you 
  will need to guide them along by searching for the CMake environment variable that tells them where to look (this location is in
  the error message usually). Bullet is particularly terrible since you have to explicitly find each lib. You will have to 
  explicitly find each lib for the cmake variables that have _LIBRARY in their name, not ending in _DIR.
